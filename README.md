April 13-15, 2015 Belgrade

## Preparations / requirements

To make the most of our time next week and since online connectivity at the workshop venue has been traditionally sporadic, please ensure you have the following requirements met before the workshop begins on Monday:

- [Java JDK 7 or 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org)
- [Counterclockwise (CCW)](http://doc.ccw-ide.org/documentation.html#install-as-standalone-product)

The last tool (CCW) is an Eclipse based Clojure IDE, which is x-platform, easy to install and we already used successfully in [last year's workshop](https://github.com/learn-postspectacular/resonate-workshop-2014). However, this just a recommendation and you're of course free to use any other editor.

Please also already clone this repo and execute the following to force downloading most (if not all) other necessary library dependencies:

```
cd resonate-workshop-2015
lein deps
```
