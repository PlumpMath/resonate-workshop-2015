## Preparations / requirements

To make the most of our time next week and since online connectivity at the workshop venue has been traditionally sporadic, please ensure you have the following requirements met before the workshop begins on Monday:

- [Java JDK 7 or 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org)

Please also already clone this repo and execute the following to force downloading most (if not all) other necessary library dependencies:

```
cd resonate-workshop-2015
lein deps
```

## Get in touch

If you run into any problems, please get in touch via the above [gitter.im room](https://gitter.im/learn-postspectacular/resonate-workshop-2015), which we will use as backchannel.
